Crazy 8 is a fun and fast-paced card game that is perfect for family and friends. In the South African version of the game, we use a special local twist.

## Objective
The goal of the game is to be the first player to discard all of your cards. You can play cards that match the top card of the discard pile in either rank or suit. If you cannot play a card, you must pick one from the deck. The game is played with 2 to 8 players.

## Setup
- The deck consists of two standard 52-card decks.
- Each player is dealt 8 cards at the start of the game.
- The remaining deck is placed face down to form the draw pile.
- One card from the draw pile is placed face up to start the discard pile.

## How to Play

### Card Values:
- **Number Cards (2-10)**: Playable if they match the number or suit of the top card on the discard pile.
- **Jack (Jika)**: This card acts as a "reverse" card. When played, the order of play is reversed. (Fun Fact: The Jack card is called "Jika," which means "turn around" in local slang and starts with a "J.")
- **8**: This card is a wild card and can be played at any time. The player who plays an 8 gets to choose the suit that the next player must follow.
- **2**: When played, the next player must pick up 2 cards and lose their turn.
- **7**: When played, the next player is skipped, and the turn is passed to the player after them.
  
### Turn Order:
1. Players take turns in order. On your turn, you must play a card that matches the suit or number of the card on the discard pile. If you cannot play a card, you must draw one card from the deck.
2. If you draw a card and it is playable, you may immediately play it. Otherwise, the turn ends.
3. The first player to discard all of their cards wins.

### Ending the Game:
The game ends when one player discards all of their cards.
